				<h2>Equipement</h2>
				<p>
				To ski tour you need all the pieces necessary to be able to climb the mountain before going down.
				Ski Touring requires a different kind of ski binding as well as a special kind of ski boots.
				Don't forget to bring skins, which are strips you put underneath your skies, which prevents from sliding down the hill.
				You must ensure you are familiar with how to use a beacon and compass to properly find your way up or down the mountain.
				This list is not a complete ski touring equipment list, this is because there are simply too many items that you should bring.
				Make sure you do extensive research for dangerous trips like these.
