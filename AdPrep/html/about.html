				<dt><b>Why Preparing is Important</b></dt>
				<dd>Adventure Prep was made to help normalize Adventure Preperation.</dd>
				<dd>Adventure Preperation is not only needed to ensure safety,</dd>
				<dd>But it also makes the experience more fun and memorable!</dd>
				<dd>Preparing for a trip shifts your mind state to better adapt to what you will face.</dd>
				<dd>You have less of chance of being surprised or nervous on the big day.</dd>

				<dt><b>How Adventure Prep helps you Prepare for a Trip</b></dt>
				<dd>The goal of adventure prep is to offer as many free tools that can help people prepare themselves for the outdoors.</dd>
				<dd>We have info on our website that explains how to safely participate in various outdoor activities, <a href="summer.html">click here</a>.</dd>
				<dd>We also have an equipment checklist that can help you organize your equipment necessary for the trip, <a href="dashboard.html">click here</a>.</dd>
				<dd>If you would like to find some good online information on how to safely go on outdoor trips <a href="resources.html">click here</a>.</dd>
				<dd>We plan on adding socializing features that will alow users to share their trip plans with others.</dd>
				<dd>There will also be a map feature to add geolocation option for trips and a route of your trip.</dd>
				<dd>All these things put together, and I hope that I can one day make a multifaceted social media platform.</dd>
				<dd>The goal is to encourage friends they made online or in person to go on adventures outside in nature.</dd>
				<dd>Whilst also helping people become more aware of the dangers of nature and facilitate their preperation.</dd>

				<dt><b>Why I Wanted to Make Adventure Prep</b></dt>
				<dd>The reason I chose to make Adventure Prep is because I experienced the dangers of not being prepared.</dd>
				<dd>One skiing accident in particular deeply shook me, it forced me to rethink how I approach not only skiing but life in general.</dd>
				<dd>The accident I had could have been so easily prevented, simply if I had known that it was a possibility.</dd>
				<dd>Often times the biggest importance for practicing safety is not how well equipped you are,</dd>
				<dd>But rather how informed you are on what the dangers are and what your first course of action given this scenario.</dd>
				<dd>That's why I've always wanted to use an all ecomposing outdoors social media platofrm,</dd>
				<dd>Where you can not only read guides but also see others past trips and be able to learn from real data of real people.</dd>
